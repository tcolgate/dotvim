# A smattering of vim bits

- colors/edit\_wb.vim: A fork of Mike Williams' print\bw.vim intended for editing. The goal is to keep some subtle hints via typeface, but get rid of the strain and distraction of colors. Vim uses syntax highlighting for more than just colour (e.g. context), so I can still use those features.
